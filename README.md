This assignment consists of two technical products. 

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News 
- Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup). 

- The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted. 

- The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries. 

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data 

The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Pandas/Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. 

The data was analyzed to answer the following questions: 

- How many months exist on Mars? 

- How many Martian days' worth of data are there? 

- Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? 

- Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? 

- How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within was made. 

The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file.
